\title{Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Interview Questions}
\maketitle
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is POS (Part of Speech) tagging? What is the simplest approach to building a POS tagger that you can imagine?
	\item How would you train a model that identifies whether the word "Apple" in a sentence belongs to the fruit or the company?
	\item Design a recommendation system.
	\item What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?
	\item How would you build a system that auto corrects text that has been generated by a speech recognition system?
	\item What is regular grammar? Does this differ in power to a regular expression and if so, in what way?
	\item How would you build a POS tagger from scratch given a corpus of annotated sentences? How would you deal with unknown words?
	\item How would you find all the occurrences of quoted text in a news article? 
	\item How would you build a system to translate English text to Greek and vice-versa?
	\item How would you build a system that automatically groups news articles by subject?
	\item What are stop words? Describe an application in which stop words should be removed.
	\item How would you design a model to predict whether a movie review was positive or negative?
	\item What is entropy? How would you estimate the entropy of the English language?
	\item What is the TF-IDF score of a word and in what context is this useful?
	\item How does the PageRank algorithm work?
	\item What is dependency parsing?
	\item What are the difficulties in building and using an annotated corpus of text such as the Brown Corpus and what can be done to mitigate them?
	\item Are you familiar with WordNet or other related linguistic resources?
	\item Do you have any experience in building ontologies?
	\item Do you speak any foreign languages?
	\item What tools for training NLP models (nltk, Apache OpenNLP, GATE, MALLET etc.,) have you used?
	\item Describe approaches to data mining of customer logs.
	\item What is feature extraction and how would you perform it?
	\item How would you handle dirty data?
	\item How do you build a system similar to Netflix?
	\item How do you implement convolutional neural networks?
	\item Provide details about LDA and Gibbs Sampling?
	\item What do you mean by Rejection Sampling?
	\item Describe a Random Forest.
	\item Why does one use MSE as a measure of quality. What is the scientific/mathematical reason for the same?
	\item Given an objective function, calculate the range of its learning rate?
